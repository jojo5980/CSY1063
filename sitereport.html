                (CSY1063-STD) As a student of computers, I admire the subject of web development. 
                Throughout this course, I learnt the criteria for creating an organised and user-friendly 
                website. I have completed a variety of HTML and CSS activities to enhance my web development 
                skills as I have studied this topic. I have looked at a number of websites to get more ideas 
                on how to build a more dynamic website for users. I also took inspiration from some of my 
                favourite websites for my work on a portfolio website. I found some pretty great tools that helped 
                me design incredibly colourful functionality for my website, which largely used CSS. If you have 
                mastered everything in this particular module, my main focus is to improve on my skills on Web 
                Development such as creating websites for high-rank clients, be able to work with people within 
                a team and many other application.

            <h1><u>Mobile Optimization</u></h1>
            <p>
                When I ran my code's mobile optimisation, I discovered a lot of difficulties. After hours of reading 
                and watching material through NILE, I was able to correctly regroup and order my code by employing 
                more of the div class codes that were supplied. My portfolio website is much more responsive than 
                before.
            </p>
        
            <h2>CSS Validation</h2>
            <p>As asked, I built two CSS files that comprise all of the pages 
               that include all ofthe style for my website's main page for desktop and mobile views.
               In order to make my online portfolio stand out, I employed a variety of 
               CSS features.It is obvious that it stands out. 
               Screenshots with CSS and HTML codes are provided below.
